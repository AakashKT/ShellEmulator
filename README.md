# ShellEmulator (Linux, Unix)

This is a Linux/Unix shell emulator. 
Have fun messing with it :D

If you have suggestions, please feel free to create a branch and make changes

Supports all commands. (maybe not all :P)<br>
Also supports "forking" a process to the background like we do on linux<br>

<b>Sep 27, 2016 Update : </b>Added support for piping and I/O redirection with background processes</br>
