# ShellEmulator (Linux, Unix)

This is a Linux/Unix shell emulator. 
Have fun messing with it :D

Supports all commands.<br>
Also supports "forking" a process to the background like we do on linux<br>
<br>
<b>Sep 27, 2016 Update : </b>Added support for piping and I/O redirection with background processes</br>
</br>
Example.<br> vi &<br>
The '&' symbol will make the process run in background, and the shell will not wait for it to finish. The process ID of the new process is printed.
